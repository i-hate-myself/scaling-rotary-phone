# youtube-dl_GUi
youtube-dl gui in c# uses youtube-dl.exe
make sure to have them in the same directory
this will not always be up to date so if there are problems download the newest version of youtube-dl
no matter what it says it will download in C:\users\user\downloads
//TODO remove that message box
sorry linux users
